### [Parallelise the datalog engine Datacat](https://github.com/joakim-brannstrom/blog/blob/master/posts/2018-07-24.md)

In which our intrepid hero attempts to leverage multicore processors to improve the performance of Datacat. The story describe the process and thinking that goes into optimizing `datacat`. Some pitfalls and mistakes that happened along the way. The end result is kind a cute. An improvement but not as much as the hero had hoped for.

Update: Added the post to the D forum.
Update: Fixed the graspan1 metrics.
Update: Added a section about the simplified version. Surprising results.

#### [TODO article](https://github.com/joakim-brannstrom/blog/blob/master/posts/2018-05-07.md)

An abstract. About 2-3 sentences.

Update: any changes to the article.
